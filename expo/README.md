# Welcome to your Rork app

## Project info

This is a native cross-platform mobile app created with [Rork](https://rork.com)

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use Rork**

Simply visit [rork.com](https://rork.com) and prompt to build your app with AI.

Changes made via Rork will be committed automatically to this GitHub repo.

Whenever you make a change in your local code editor and push it to GitHub, it will be also reflected in Rork.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Rork.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Recommended)**

1. **iOS**: Download the [Rork app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/rork) or [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
2. **Android**: Download the [Expo Go app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
3. Run `bun run start` and scan the QR code from your development server

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

You can test Rork apps in Expo Go or Rork iOS app. You don't need XCode or Android Studio for most features.

**When do you need Custom Development Builds?**

- Native authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Push notifications
- Custom native modules

If you have XCode (iOS) or Android Studio installed:

```bash
# iOS Simulator
bun run start -- --ios

# Android Emulator
bun run start -- --android
```

## Custom Development Builds

For advanced native features, you'll need to create a Custom Development Build instead of using Expo Go.

### **When do you need a Custom Development Build?**

- **Native Authentication**: Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In, Google Sign In
- **In-App Purchases**: App Store and Google Play subscriptions
- **Advanced Native Features**: Third-party SDKs, platform-specifc features (e.g. Widgets on iOS)
- **Background Processing**: Background tasks, location tracking

### **Creating a Custom Development Build**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```

## Advanced Features

### **Add a Database**

Integrate with backend services:

- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL database with real-time features
- **Firebase** - Google's mobile development platform
- **Custom API** - Connect to your own backend

### **Authentication (implemented — Keycloak)**

This app authenticates against **Keycloak**. Credentials are entered directly
on the app's login page and exchanged via Keycloak's **Direct Access Grant**
(resource-owner password) at the token endpoint — no browser popup. Browser
sheets (via [Expo AuthSession](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/authentication/),
OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE) are used only for:

- **Brokered identity providers** (Google, Apple, …): buttons appear when
  enabled in the admin auth-method config and open the provider directly via
  `kc_idp_hint` — the flow stays centralized through Keycloak.
- **Registration**: the "Sign Up" link opens Keycloak's hosted registration
  page (OIDC `registrations` endpoint) and signs the new user in on completion.
- **Password reset**: "Forgot Password?" opens Keycloak's hosted
  reset-credentials page.

Other details:

- The OAuth redirect returns to `skateboardpodcast://auth/callback` (see
  `app/+native-intent.tsx`; the scheme must match `app.json`); tokens are
  stored via `core/services/tokenStorage.ts` (SecureStore on native,
  AsyncStorage on web).
- `core/services/api.ts` attaches the Bearer token to every backend call and
  silently refreshes it against Keycloak's token endpoint.
- **Guest access** stays backend-issued (`POST /api/auth/guest`) and never
  touches Keycloak.

Keycloak client requirements (admin console):

- Client (`EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID`): **Direct access grants** enabled;
  redirect URIs cover `skateboardpodcast://auth/callback` and the web origin's
  `/auth/callback` (plus web origins for CORS on the token endpoint).
- Realm: **User registration** enabled (Sign Up link) and **brute force
  detection** on (the direct grant bypasses the hosted page's UI protections,
  not the server-side detector).
- Note: accounts with pending required actions (verify email, forced password
  update) or OTP cannot complete the direct grant — the app shows a message
  pointing them to the browser sign-in to finish setup.

Configuration (`.env`):

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8180
EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_REALM=skateboard-podcast
EXPO_PUBLIC_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=skateboard-podcast-fe
```

Local Keycloak + backend setup lives in the backend repo
(`docker compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d` — see its README).
Android emulator note: run `adb reverse tcp:8180 tcp:8180` and
`adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` so the token issuer matches the backend's
configured issuer URI. The auth code lives in `core/services/keycloakAuth.ts`
and `core/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.

### **Add Push Notifications**

Send notifications to your users:

- **Expo Notifications** - Cross-platform push notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** - Advanced notification features

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

For web deployments, you can use custom domains with:

- **EAS Hosting** - Custom domains available on paid plans
- **Netlify** - Free custom domain support
- **Vercel** - Custom domains with automatic SSL

For mobile apps, you'll configure your app's deep linking scheme in `app.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### **App not loading on device?**

1. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. Try using tunnel mode: `bun start -- --tunnel`
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection

### **Build failing?**

1. Clear your cache: `bunx expo start --clear`
2. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
3. Check [Expo's troubleshooting guide](https://docs.expo.dev/troubleshooting/build-errors/)
